## [Demo](https://aiddun.github.io/enzyme) (outdated for now)

A much, much faster grade distribution viewer for UT Austin, using React, a much faster precomputed search index (Flexsearch), table virtualization, and caching.

This is a prototype, and is not yet a finished product

Compare speed to: [UT Catalyst](http://utcatalyst.org/grade-distributions)
